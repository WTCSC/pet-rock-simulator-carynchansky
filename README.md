# Overview

__Pet Rock Simulator__ is a lightweight, text-based game written in Python.
Adopt a virtual rock, give it a name, and keep it alive by balancing its happiness, hunger, and thirst levels.

### Features

* __Interactive Gameplay__ – Feed, play, bathe, or simply chill with your pet rock.

* __Simple Stats System__ – Happiness, Hunger, and Thirst each range from 0–10.

* __Dynamic Outcomes__ – Neglect your pet and it may become sad… or even die!

### Requirements

* Python 3.8+ (no external libraries needed)

* A terminal or command prompt to run the script.

### How to Run

1. Open a terminal or command prompt in the script’s directory.

2. Create a clone of a git hub repository:

    __git clone link-to-repository__

3. Open a repository:

    __cd pet-rock-simulator__

4. Run:

    __python3 pet_rock.py__

5. Follow the on-screen prompts.

### Gameplay

1. __Name Your Pet__ – Give your rock some personality.

2. __Choose Actions__ each turn:

    * __Give food__ – Increases hunger, lowers thirst slightly.

    * __Play__ – Boosts happiness, but uses up hunger & thirst.

    * __Do nothing__ – Time passes; stats slowly drop.

    * __Bathe your pet__ – Increases happiness.
 
    * __Give water__ – Rehydrates and cheers your rock.

    * __Exit game__ – Say goodbye.

3. __Watch the Stats__ – If hunger or thirst hits zero, or happiness stays at zero for too long, your pet’s health is at risk.

### Tips

* Balance __food__ and __water__: feeding raises hunger but lowers thirst.

* Don’t forget to __play__ or your rock will get lonely.

* __Bathing__ is a quick happiness boost when needed.
